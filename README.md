# TypesForBukkit

This is a Typescript module to help me autcomplete the Bukkit API for the [PlaceholderAPI Javascript Expansion](https://github.com/PlaceholderAPI/Javascript-Expansion). This is meant to be imported into a Javascript file and then commented out when you actually want to use it in game
