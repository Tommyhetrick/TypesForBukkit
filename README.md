# TypesForBukkit

This is a Typescript module to help me autcomplete the Bukkit API for the [PlaceholderAPI Javascript Expansion](https://github.com/PlaceholderAPI/Javascript-Expansion). 

Just add a triple slash reference directive and automcomplete away!

Newer versions will build upon previous versions. Classes that have changed will have new "patched" files but classes that have not change will reference the last version that did change.

Currently working on initial version (Bukkit for minecraft 1.16.5)
